Chess Bot Programming.
 - in BoardScanner Class, 
  When detecting changes, don't parse all, board on each iteration. Try to compare whole board image without parsing, to cells instead.
 - previously matched image ordering must be done with piece type, it must not be related with highlighted or selected vs.vs.	 
  - Known problem = We always expect 3 change in board when premove succeded. but in reality there is posibility for 5 changes or even 7 changes. 7 changes = 4 castling + 3 premove operation.
  but for now we ignore this. Maybe if we decrease scanning board time, then we almost never face with this cruel issue.
  Certainly there is a solution to this problem. but it may be implemented in future releases.
 * It is both problem to see the premove too early and too late.
 if it is too early, there is posibility to see uncompleted premove.
 if it is too late, there is posibility to see completed premove + normal move. say it is 3 moves...
  * In Premove detection,
// OMH, What if same type of piece recaptures?? Than prevToItem equals to currToItem???
 - Implement promotions on online chess bot.
 [OKEY] - Implement draw and mate detection correctly.
   - in chess bot, should we clear TT in every suggest? or only reset bot?

	 Reminder
  - Change Random Number Generator from HardCodedSecureRandom to SecureRandom Again.
  - There should be More smart way to DECIDE premove. (cause it slows down the core engine :()
  - There is a bug in pre move :) Vezirle almasý mecburi deðildi. piyonla alsa bizim pre move boþa çýkacak.
